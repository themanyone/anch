The Anchor pseudocode compiler adds curly braces and semicolons to code written in various programming languages, saving typing, possibly reducing errors, and making programs easier to read. It lets programmers code in something that looks like VB, Python or Lua while actually writing standard C, Java, PHP, C++, .NET, C#, or D. An example bash script integrates with the [Tiny C compiler](http://bellard.org/tcc/) to make runnable "scripts" with the speed of C.
