anch.org: Anchor

   Advanced Negative Compilation Heuristic Ontological Refactorer

   Version: 1.6

   Anchor: for  i=5;i--;  C: for (i=5;i--;){

  Why Anchor?

   If (code == indented) {brackets = redundant}. Refactoring with Anchor
   saves typing and makes programs easier to read. Best of all, it's free!

   Techies might refer to it as a language-independent pseudocode compiler or
   code decorator but all it does is fix missing brackets and punctuation.

  Where to get it

   Anchor now is hosted on Google Code. Subversion, user wiki and issue
   trackers available.

  Installation

   A windows .exe is provided already. Just copy it somewhere in the
   computer`s path. Compilation on Linux and other systems requires flex and
   a C compiler. Download and extract the archive.

 unzip anchor.zip
 cd anchor

   Run "make" from within the newly extracted directory.

 make
 su -c `make install`

  Programming with Anchor

   The rules are very simple. A double-space, "  " (tells anchor to enclose
   the rest of the line in parenthesis). Indentation of 4 spaces {controls
   the placement of curly brackets}. The remaining lines are automatically
   terminated with semicolons; any of these rules may be overridden by
   placing whitespace or a /* comment */ or // at the end of the line,
   causing the precompiler to skip the line in question.

  Compilation

   Example usage: converting example.a.c to C:

 anchor example.a.c > example.c

   Compiling the result with gcc (or any C compiler).

 gcc example.c -o example.exe

   If the indent style Anchor produces is undesirable for some reason, simply
   run GNU indent on it. The default GNU indent style should work for most
   people. See man indent for more GNU indent styles.

 indent example.c

   Anchor knows nothing about the underlying language, so it should process a
   variety of curly bracket languages. The author uses it on C code, but it
   should work with little or no change on C++, Java, .NET, PHP, Perl, awk
   and other types of bracketed configuration files or scripts. Programs may
   be compiled on Linux or unix by putting "anch" in front of the existing
   compiler or interpreter. Windows users would need to install something
   like MingW, cygwin, or some other unix-like bourne shell to interpret the
   included "anch" script.

 make example
 anch gcc example.a.c -o example

   Lossy "un-anchoring" of code is provided by a really crappy bash script
   (requires GNU indent). It needs to be re-written in flex.

 unanchor example.c #see how it might look
 unanchor example.c > editme.a.c # create a file

   see an unanchored C windows program

  Optional TinyCC integration

   The latest version of TinyCC may be gotten from the git repo or mob branch
   and compiled separately. A mob-release Linux (RPM) version of TCC may be
   found here.

   With TinyCC (TCC) installed, Anchor can execute pseudocode directly from
   the command line.

 anch -run example.a.c

   Or put the following line

 #!/usr/local/bin/anch -run [args]

   at the top of files to make executable C scripts:

 #!/usr/local/bin/anch -run
 #include <stdio.h>
 int main  int c, char **v
     while  c--
         printf  "Argument %i is \"%s\"\n",c,v[c]
     return 0

  Direct execution

   The anch script can use TCC to execute through a pipe. For example, if
   both xsel and TCC are installed, the above code may be highlighted with
   the mouse and executed directly from the selection buffer, with arguments
   (and without even saving to disk).

 xsel | anch -run - [args]

   Other compilers or interpreters may be invoked through pipes as well:

 xsel|anchor|gcc -Wall -g -xc -

  Bugs, wiki, changelog

   The bugs, wiki, and changelog have moved to Google Code. Bugs may be
   reported using the issue tracker. The latest version may be checked out
   from svn, and the wiki may contain updates, tips, and suggestions from
   users.

  Limitations and Copyright

   No warrantee! Anchor was created as a learning toy for hobbies and fun; it
   might lack the swagger of commercial projects. The algorithm is
   potentially lossy and subject to change, so don't distribute important
   software that depends on it (convert it to the target language first).
   Programming is a difficult task and Anchor is not guaranteed to make it
   easier. Our "precompiler", anch is just a simple bash script that creates
   a temp file and invokes whatever compiler is normally used. These tools
   may be freely adapted under the terms of the Gnu Public License.
