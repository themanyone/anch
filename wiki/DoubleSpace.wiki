#summary Anchor's double space macro

Parenthesis shall open and _close_ whenever *two consecutive spaces* { }{ } are encountered or until the end of a line that _does not_ end in a comma or space.
-----------------

`void myFunc`<span style="background-color:yellow">  </span>

becomes `void myFunc () {`

This however does not work:
{{{
/* before */
int main void
/* after :( */
int main void;
}}}

There needs to be *2 spaces* between 'main' and 'void'!

This also works:

`if`<span style="background-color:yellow">  </span>`j==4`<span style="background-color:yellow">  </span>`printf`<span style="background-color:yellow">  </span>`"Hi!"`

becomes
{{{
if (j==4)printf ("Hi!");
}}}

Tricks:

A *single space*, comma or actually any of the characters `"/,=!@#$%^&*}\\ "` at the end of a line will cause ')' to be put further down:

{{{
/* before */
printf  "Hello "> </span>
        "World!"
/* after */
printf ("Hello " 
        "World!");
}}}

If extra () are appearing in your code you probably have "double spaces in odd places."
