#summary Anchor's double space macro

This
{{{
#include <stdio.h>
/* Print command line arguments and exit. */
int main  int c, char **v
    while  c--
        printf  "Argument %i is \"%s\"\n",c,v[c]
    return 0
}}}

becomes this:

{{{
#include <stdio.h>
/* Print command line arguments and exit. */
int main (int c, char **v){
    while (c--){
        printf ("Argument %i is \"%s\"\n",c,v[c]);
    }
    return 0;
}
}}}

It might not be obvious, but there are two spaces between main and int.

The following will also work because there are two trailing spaces after main.

{{{
int main  
}}}

This, however, will fail:

{{{
int main
}}}

It looks the same, but there are no spaces after main.

This macro is not perfect and sometimes acts up.

If extra () are appearing in your code you probably have "double spaces in odd places."

If the double space macro is confusing, just put your own parenthesis around things and avoid double spaces.
