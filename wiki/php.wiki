= PHP =

A PHP test has been added. You can now run PHP scripts with anchor.

Code may be run right from the terminal without saving any files. Just copy and paste:

{{{
anchor <<"EOF"|php -a
for  $i = 3; $i--;
    printf  "outer loop $i\n"
    for  $x = 0;$x < 3; $x++
        printf("    inner loop $x\n");
EOF
}}}

The above code will also run as a perl script.
