A PHP test has been added. You can now run PHP scripts with anchor.

Code may be run right from this web page without saving any files. Just copy and paste into a terminal:

{{{
anchor <<"EOF"|php -a
for  $i = 3; $i--;
    echo  "outer loop $i\n"
    for  $x = 0;$x < 3; $x++
        echo("    inner loop $x\n");
EOF
}}}
